# App Name

This is a sample app that demonstrates the use of Clean Architecture and Firebase. The app allows users to [insert app's main functionality here]. 

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Set up your Firebase project and add the Firebase configuration file to the app
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device

## Architecture

This app follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which separates the app into distinct layers of responsibility. The layers are as follows:

- **Presentation:** This layer contains the UI components and handles user interactions. It communicates with the domain layer via interfaces.
- **Domain:** This layer contains the use cases and business logic of the app. It communicates with the data layer via interfaces.
- **Data:** This layer contains the implementation of the interfaces defined in the domain layer. It communicates with external data sources, such as Firebase.

The benefit of Clean Architecture is that it allows for easy testing, maintainability, and scalability of the app.

## Firebase Integration

This app uses Firebase for [insert the features that are using Firebase here]. To integrate Firebase into the app, follow these steps:

1. Set up your Firebaseproject and add the `google-services.json` configuration file to the `app` directory of the project.
2. Add the necessary Firebase dependencies to the `build.gradle` files of the app module.
3. Configure the Firebase services that you will be using in the app, such as Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Messaging, Firebase Analytics, etc.
4. Use the Firebase SDKs to interact with the Firebase services in your app code.
