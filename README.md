# App Name

This is a sample app that demonstrates the use of Clean Architecture and Firebase. The app allows users to [insert app's main functionality here]. 

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Set up your Firebase project and add the Firebase configuration file to the app
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device

## Architecture
this app use firebase  as backend
This app follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which separates the app into distinct layers of responsibility. The layers are as follows:

- **Presentation:** This layer contains the UI components and handles user interactions. It communicates with the domain layer via interfaces.
- **Domain:** This layer contains the use cases and business logic of the app. It communicates with the data layer via interfaces.
- **Data:** This layer contains the implementation of the interfaces defined in the domain layer. It communicates with external data sources, such as Firebase.

The benefit of Clean Architecture is that it allows for easy testing, maintainability, and scalability of the app.
